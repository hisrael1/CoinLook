I need to rememeber to take this out of scripts.

I need to write a high level overview of my code and have an idea of what I need to do before 
writing any syntax or looking anything up.

I finally figure out how to extract data from the API. Now I just need to find what to do with it.



I think I'll store it in a variable and go on to D3.



//    A: Storing it in a variable to reference later (might need to import stuff or save it a certain way for it to be referencable)
//    B: Just returning it
//    C: Learning about D3 and figuring out what to do from there.
