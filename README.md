# Sample JS Project Proposal: CoinLook
## Background
The discovery and invention of blockchain technology could wind up as one of the most impactful events in technology since the introduction of the internet. For my project, I plan to create a cryptocurrency data visualization app. The app allows the user to specify specific coins as well as buy and sell dates to see how much they would have made had they bought and sold at that time. The app will show a data time lapse in order to see the change in price over time in the form of an interactive bar chart. Users will also be able to hover over specific time frames to access information and pertinent data. This will all be done  using D3 and the CoinGecko API.

## Functionality & MVPs
With CoinLook, users will be able to:
Specify start and end dates for coins in order to see charts of how the coin has progressed
Access general time lapsed data as well as the ability to hover over specific times for more detailed data
The ability to click on specific dates to return a google search for a coin on that specific date
In addition, this project will include:
An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
A production README

## Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, my LinkedIn and AngelList, and the About modal.
Game controls will include Buy, Sell, and Coin search button.
Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
The data will be extracted from the CoinGekko API 
Webpack and D3 to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
npm to manage project dependencies\

## Implementation Timeline
- Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get familiar with d3 data visualization methods and protocols. Create Coin class. 
- Monday: Get the data from the API correctly linked to the page. 
- Tuesday: Make sure everything rerenders correctly. Then, focus on user controls: buy, sell, and the other visual components.
- Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.
- Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
